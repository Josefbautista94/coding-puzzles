# Coding Puzzles & Algorithm Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various coding puzzles and algorithm challenges.  
The problems cover a range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, and logical problem-solving.  
The goal of this repo is to document my learning process, improve my problem-solving skills, and showcase my coding style.

## üìÇ Structure

The problems are organized by difficulty level:

```
warmup/      # Introductory puzzles to get familiar with problem-solving patterns
level1/      # Fundamental data structures & algorithms
level2/      # Intermediate problems with more complex logic
level3/      # Advanced data structure and algorithm challenges
level4/      # Highly complex puzzles combining multiple advanced concepts
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
